### PhD in Complex Systems

+ **Maringá State University (UEM)** | Maringá, Brazil
+ **Period:** 2024 – 2028 (expected)
+ **Advisor:** Haroldo Valentin Ribeiro

My doctoral research is situated within the field of Complex Systems, focusing on the "Science of Science" area. The project involves a large-scale analysis of research metrics and collaboration networks, primarily using data from the Lattes platform—the main curriculum vitae database for the Brazilian scientific community. In this project, by applying complex network, physics, and statistics theory, we aim to identify key structural patterns related to researchers careers and other features for scientific evaluation. A specific goal is to quantify how collaboration influences scientific productivity and impact across different fields.

### Master's in Applied Physics

+ **Campinas State University (UNICAMP)** | Campinas, Brazil
+ **Period:** 2021 – 2023
+ **Dissertation:** *Vorticity rings in relativistic heavy ion collisions*
+ **Advisor:** Jun Takahashi

My master's research focused on modeling the thermalization of jets in Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) and measuring this process via Lambda particle polarization. I investigated jet thermalization by studying the formation of vorticity rings within a hydrodynamic description of the QGP medium, employing a state-of-the-art computational simulation chain to model the dynamics of hadron collisions. This work involved reproducing experimental conditions and extracting information from particle polarization, applying and strengthening my expertise in relativistic hydrodynamics, data analysis, and large-scale computational simulation.

### Bachelor's in Physics

+ **Maringá State University (UEM)** | Maringá, Brazil
+ **Period:** 2017 – 2021

During my undergraduate period, my research experience centered on applying computational methods to solve problems in physics. I began with a scientific initiation project in condensed matter, where I worked with a numerical model of temporal evolution of Nematic Liquid Crystals. Building on this foundation, my bachelor's thesis investigated the dynamics of the Double Harmonic Oscillator; for this, I developed C-based numerical solutions using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and analyzed frequency components with Fourier Transforms. These projects progressively solidified my skills in analytical modeling, numerical simulation, and scientific programming.
