#summary: "This study investigates the formation of vorticity rings as a mechanism for jet thermalization in high-energy nuclear collisions, using relativistic viscous hydrodynamic simulations. It introduces a robust observable linked to Λ-hyperon polarization, providing a novel way to probe jet–medium interactions and the vorticity structure of the quark–gluon plasma."
