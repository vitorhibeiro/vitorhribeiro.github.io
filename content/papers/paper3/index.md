summary: "Report produced during the Complexity 72h workshop, in Madrid. This study investigates how species interactions change over time in ecological communities by developing a time-varying network model grounded in generalized Lotka–Volterra dynamics with environmental covariates. Applying the model to five long-term datasets from different ecosystems, the authors quantify temporal rewiring of interactions, asymmetry patterns, and structural stability. They find strong evidence that ecosystems with high-resolution temporal data show substantial shifts in interaction signs and cooperation–competition balance—often linked to environmental stress—while systems with coarse sampling appear structurally stable and cooperation-dominated. The work emphasizes that both temporal resolution and environmental conditions critically shape how ecological communities persist and coexist."
