summary: "Report produced during the Complexity 72h workshop, in Madrid. This study investigates how species interactions change over time in ecological communities by developing a time-varying network model grounded in generalized Lotka–Volterra dynamics with environmental covariates. Applying the model to five long-term datasets from different ecosystems, the authors quantify temporal rewiring of interactions, asymmetry patterns, and structural stability. They find strong evidence that ecosystems with high-resolution temporal data show substantial shifts in interaction signs and cooperation–competition balance—often linked to environmental stress—while systems with coarse sampling appear structurally stable and cooperation-dominated. The work emphasizes that both temporal resolution and environmental conditions critically shape how ecological communities persist and coexist."

##### Abstract

Ecological communities are composed of species interactions that respond to environmental fluctuations. Despite increasing evidence of temporal variation in these interactions, most theoretical frameworks remain rooted in static assumptions. Here, we develop and apply a time-varying network model to five long-term ecological datasets spanning diverse taxa and environments. Using a generalized Lotka-Volterra framework with environmental covariates, we quantify temporal rewiring of interspecific interactions, asymmetry patterns, and structural stability. Our results reveal contrasting dynamics across ecosystems: in datasets with rich temporal resolution, interaction networks exhibit marked rewiring and shifts in cooperation-competition ratios that correlate with environmental stress, consistent, though not always linearly, with the stress-gradient hypothesis. Conversely, in datasets with coarser temporal sampling, networks retain constant interaction sign structure and remain in cooperation-dominated regimes. These findings highlight the importance of temporal resolution and environmental context in shaping ecological coexistence.
