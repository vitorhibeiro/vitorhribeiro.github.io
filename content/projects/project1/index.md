### My collaboration network

Science is rarely a solitary endeavor. In the context of the Science of Science, this project applies network science principles to map my own academic journey. The visualization below represents my co-authorship network, where nodes correspond to researchers and edges represent joint publications. This topological structure highlights the communities and collaborative dynamics that have shaped my academic career up to now.

This project is an interactive visualization built using Python, NetworkX, and PyVis.
